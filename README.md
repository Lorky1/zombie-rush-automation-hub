## 🗒️ Functions Description

### **1. Dynamic Zombie-Handling Algorithm**
An advanced automation sequence that scales complexity based on user input and real-time ‘zombie’ count. Not just another bot—this script learns and adapts, evolving its strategy just like an actual outbreak.

### **2. Multi-Language Messaging**
Communicate with your AI automation in your own tongue (or another’s!). The script automatically detects and adjusts to language preferences, making workflow smooth and inclusive.

### **3. AI-Driven Command Center**
With integrated OpenAI and Claude APIs, Zombie Rush Script provides context-aware recommendations, predictive ‘survival’ tips, and custom script enhancements. Imagine coding with a council of AI brains backing you up.

### **4. Modular Plug-in System**
Easily extend the ‘core’ to include maps, custom automation triggers, or external data sources—whatever you need for your unique ‘outbreak scenario’.

### **5. Real-Time Adaptivity**
No two sessions are the same. The script senses changes in operating environment (even switching OS), morphing its interface and logic to keep users productive in every situation.
